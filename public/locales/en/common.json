    "faq.subtitle_2" : "What is special about the ‘Squid Game Card’?",
    "faq.subtitle_2_content_1" : "- ‘Squid Game Card’ was created by modifying the basic design idea and smart contract code of Loot Project’s Loot NFT. Just as Loot NFT is the building block of Loot Metaverse, it is a building block of ‘Squid Game Metaverse’.",
    "faq.subtitle_2_content_2" : "- 'Squid Game Card' is issued in a completely decentralized way, and in a completely different way from the centralized metaverse, objects are used as adjuncts to games or stories that determine the 'meaning of cards' in order to construct a decentralized metaverse. It is designed to have enough properties on an independent object without defining it.",
    "faq.subtitle_2_content_3" : "- 'Squid Game' was born from the Loot Project, but it solved some problems with Loot tokens (eg, excessive gas cost).",
    
    "faq.subtitle_3" : "Can I create a game or community with the ‘Squid Game Card’?",
    "faq.subtitle_3_content_1" : "-  Of course! For users who have 'Squid Game Card', you can create your own game or community application by independently assigning qualitative characteristics to the attributes assigned to 'Hangul consonants' and 'numbers' of the 'Squid Game Card'.",

    "faq.subtitle_5" : "If only 10,000 are issued, isn't it difficult for most people to have a squid game card?",
    "faq.subtitle_5_content_1" : "-  The squid game card can issue expansion cards with its own smart contract according to each individual's needs while creating a game or community.",

    "faq.subtitle_6" : "Isn't the 11 attributes given to the squid game card not enough?",
    "faq.subtitle_6_content_1" : "- Anyone who wants to create their own game or community can introduce properties other than those granted to cards with a ‘virtual card’ contract.",

    "faq.subtitle_7" : "How is the value of the Squid Game Card determined?",
    "faq.subtitle_7_content_1" : "- The value of the squid game card is not inherent in itself, but is given by the game or community created using this card.",
    "faq.subtitle_7_content_2" : "- However, since some attributes given to squid game cards are issued with their ‘rarity’ adjusted during the issuance stage, the frequency of attribute expression can be a factor that fundamentally affects value formation.",
